# NYC_Citibike
## Overview of Analysis
For this analysis, Pandas is used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations are created to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, these new visualizations are added to the two created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
