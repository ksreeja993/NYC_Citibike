## Overview of Analysis
For this analysis, Pandas is used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations are created to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, these new visualizations are added to the two created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Summary
* Bikes are checked out for 6-7 minutes on ana verage, below is the visualization.
* Bike trips vary by hour of day with peak hour 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM.
* For future bikes for service can be showsn in a better way to just show the top 100 bikes for service.
* A visualization to show under age bike riders and older bike riders would be interesting.
